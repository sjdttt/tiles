STL files for a SENSI-PI Generic Tile
  This folder contains STL files for 3D printing Sensi-Pi tiles.
  
  For each file the base and an appropriate top need printing.
  
  The file name for the top is self explanatory... the number refers to the number of holes
  and the big/small for the two different types of banana socket I have used. (Big is for 
  sockets with solder tags).
  
  I cannot guarantee that there are not other variants of banana socket out there! 
  
  I have used No 2 self tapping fixing screws for attaching the lid and PCB. (5mm & 3 mm in length, starting with
  3mm wherever possible!)
  
  Also I have only printed these files on my ROBOX 3D printer, other printers may print sizes slightly differently depending on nozzle diameter etc. 
  
  If you have problems let me know and we can discuss the best way to resolve them and hopefully improve this repository as a consequence.
  
  The files have been designed using the OPENScad design package and I have made them as parametric as possible. I need to tidy them a bit before any release ...... but if you really need them please ask!
